                <h2>Find your friends</h2>
                <p>Buoy shows you where your friends are in real time, updating the map as you move. You can recognize your friends by their Gravatars. Clicking on their gravatar gives you access to turn-by-turn directions, a direct phone call, and any other relevant information your friends want you to know (such as any allergies or special skills they may have).</p>

                <h2>Integrated chat</h2>
                <p>Every time you send an alert, Buoy creates a secure, private chat room for responders to share. This lets you communicate with anyone who answers your alert, but also lets responders coordinate with one another regarding how best to help you. Buoy comes with a built-in chat system (pictured) that provides real-time text or video chat out of the box. It can be configured to use other chat systems with the flip of a switch.</p>

                <h2>Built for mobile</h2>
                <p>Send an alert in one click. If you are in a really severe situation, <em>you can put your phone back in your pocket</em> and deal with the situation at hand. Responders will still be able to find you even if you never again touch Buoy. One tap is all it takes to get help from the people you trust most.</p>
